  yaw_goal_tolerance: 0.05  #The allowable error of the yaw angle when reaching the target point, in radians.
  latch_xy_goal_tolerance: false   #Set to true, if the fault tolerance is reached, the robot will rotate in place, 
                                   #even if the rotation will  run out of the fault tolerance


# Forward Simulation Parameters
  sim_time: 2.5           #The time to simulate the trajectory forward.
  sim_granularity: 0.025  #the step size, the distance between the sample points on the track, and the intensity of the points on the track.

# Trajectory Scoring Parameters

# Oscillation Prevention Parameters
  oscillation_reset_dist: 0.05  #How long the robot moves to reset the oscillation mark.

# Debugging
  prune_plan: true   #Whether the robot advances to clear the track 1m away from the back.
  publish_cost_grid: false #Whether to issue the cost grid of the planner when planning the path. If set to true, the sensor_msgs/PointCloud2 type message will be posted on the ~/cost_cloud topic.
